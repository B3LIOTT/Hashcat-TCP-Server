# What is it ?

This code was created to remotely start an instance of hashcat on my desktop computer, which has a very good GPU (whereas my laptop is a bit crap).

# How ?
This code sets up a port forwarding on my personal router, which has a domain name. This allows me to crack any hash file remotely on my desktop PC.

### NOTE:
This code is not yet complete and might contain security vulnerabilities (like remote code execution). Feel free to modify the code to optimise it, maybe i'll find some time to fix it.
