# What is it ?

This code was created to remotely start an instance of hashcat on my desktop computer, which has a very good GPU (whereas my laptop is a bit crap).

# How ?
I've set up a port forwarder on my personal router, with a domain name. This allows me to crack any hash file remotely on my desktop PC.

### NOTE:
This code is not yet complete.
